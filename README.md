Automated wordle solver using Selenium.

Wordle is an online 5-letter word game. Each day a new word is released and players have six attempts to guess what the word of the day is. One of my friends got me addicted to this game, and so this weekend I decided to create a script that solves wordle using browser automation. The list of words is scraped from wordle's official website: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html" target="_blank">Wordle</a>.

I hope y'all like it.
Cheers!
:D
